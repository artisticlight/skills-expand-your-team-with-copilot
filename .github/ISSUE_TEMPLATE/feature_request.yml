        **Current System Architecture:**
        - Backend: FastAPI (`src/app.py`, `src/backend/`)
        - Database: MongoDB with collections for activities and teachers
        - Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JS (`src/static/`)
        - API: RESTful endpoints for activities and authentication
        
        **Key Components:**
        - Activities: CRUD operations via `/activities` endpoints
        - Authentication: Login system for teachers
        - Registration: Student signup for activities
        - Data Models: Activities, Teachers, Participants
        
        **Development Guidelines:**
        - Maintain backward compatibility
        - Follow existing code patterns
        - Update both API and frontend as needed
        - Consider data migration if schema changes required
